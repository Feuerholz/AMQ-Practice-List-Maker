# AMQ Practice List Maker
 
Creates an xml file to import to MAL from a json generated by [TheJoseph98's Song List script](https://github.com/TheJoseph98/AMQ-Scripts), adding only anime which had at least 1 missed song.

### Usage

1. Run the script with the generated .json file as argument (requires Python 3.0.1 or later which you can find [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
2. Import animelist.xml to MAL [here](https://myanimelist.net/import.php)

Notes:

1. All anime are added to plan to watch
2. Importing the list does not delete any existing entries, but it will update any entries that are also in the imported list to be on ptw, so regardless I would not recommend using it to import to your actual list.
3. To clear your current MAL, you can use [this script by xamantra](https://gist.github.com/xamantra/0abdec366eebcea622f569ff838a7fda)

If I knew more than a tiny bit of JS I could probably turn this into a button on the AMQ website but I cba to learn how to do that.
